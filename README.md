## Conceptial Questions

### 1. What is Java?
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with Java
* Comparison with other languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.)
##### Answer
* Object-oriented programming language
* Portable - write once, run anywhere
* Very popular today in server-side programming
* Created by Sun Microsystems, released in 1995, and is now widely used in enterprise applications

### 2. What are some freatures of Java?
##### Motivation
* Awareness of what the Java has to offer
* Comparison with other languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.)
* Importance language characteristics
##### Answer
* Simple, object-oriented, and familiar syntax to c and c++ programmers
* Robust and secure(virtual machine)
* Architecture-neutral and platform-independent(write once and run anywhere, jvm - another abstraction layer)
* High-performance(JIT compiler)
* Interpreted, threaded and dynamic(compiled, bytecode is interpreted at the runtime, typing is statically checked, behavior is dynamic)

### 3. What is JVM?
##### Motivation
* Diffrence bwtween JVM and JRE
* Characteristics of JVM
* Role it plays in execution
##### Answer
* JVM - Java virtual machine
* It's the runtime environment for Java programs, a extra layer of abstraction over the hardware
* Takes the compiled bytecode and executes it
* input to the JVM is the Bycode, output is the machine code
* Has a specification that outlines how it should work
* Diffrent implementation available
* Essentialy in making Java platform agnostic(write once and run anywhere)
##### List of JVM
* Codename One – uses the open source ParparVM
* Eclipse OpenJ9 – open-source from IBM J9, for Windows, AIX, Linux (x86, Power, and Z), macOS, MVS, OS/400, Pocket PC, z/OS.
* GraalVM – is based on HotSpot/OpenJDK, it has a polyglot feature, to transparently mix and match supported languages.
* HotSpot – the open-source Java VM implementation by Oracle.
Jikes RVM (Jikes Research Virtual Machine) – research project. PPC and IA-32. Supports Apache Harmony and GNU Classpath libraries. Eclipse Public License.
* leJOS – Robotics suite, a firmware replacement for Lego Mindstorms programmable bricks, provides a Java programming environment for the Lego Mindstorms RCX and NXT robots.
* Maxine – meta-circular open source research VM from Oracle Labs and the University of Manchester.

### 4. What is JRE?
##### Motivation
* Diffrence bwtween JVM and JRE
* Characteristics of JRE
* Role it plays in execution

##### Answer
* JRE - Java run time environment
* It is a set of software elements that together provide the environment in which Java programs are executed
* Constists of
  * Class loader
  * JVM
  * Libraries and utilities
* The JRE orchestrates the activities of these software elements
* Installed on machines that run Java

### 6. What is JDK?
##### Motivation
* Diffrence bwtween JDK and JRE
* Characteristics of JDK
* Role it plays in the development time(Author time)

##### Answer
* JDK - Java development kit
* It is a set of tools to help developers write Java programs
* Comes with a JRE(becuase you need a JRE to run the JDK)
* Based off the Java language specification
* Includes
  * Java compiler
  * Class libraries
  * Utilities

### 7. What is the difference between JVM and JRE and JDK?
##### Motivation
* Characteristics of JVM and JRE and JDK
* How they work together
##### Answer
* JDK - Software used for building Java applications
* JRE - Software used for running Java applications
* JVM - abstract virtual machine that the JRE spins up to run Java applications

### 8. What is Java bytecode?
##### Motivation
* Understanding of how Java bytecode is created/the compile process
* How it suports the portability of Java
* Relation with JVM

##### Answer
* Instructions set for the JVM to execute
* Generated by the process of the compilation of a Java program
* JVM takes the bytecode and executes it
* Can not be run natively on a machine
* Bycode is consistent across machines. But JVM implementation may vary
* This enable the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" property of Java

### 9. What is the difference between Path and classpath?
##### Motivation
* Understanding system variables
* Understanding the classpath concept
* Why we need to set this variables

##### Answer
* Both are enviromenment variables
* Path is an operation system specific variable that infuluesces what binaries(executable) are available for running
* Classpath is a Java construct to indicate where all the compiled classes and jars are available. This could be multiple locations
* Path: when I type `java` in the command line, ***JRE*** will search for the `java` binary in the PATH variable
* classpath: all the directory of  packages and classes are available in the classpath, ***compilor*** will search for the class in the classpath at the time of compilation, to see if the class is available
  
### 10. What is the difference between source path and classpath?
##### Motivation
* Understanding the project structure
* Java IDE folder structure

##### Answer
* Sourcepath is where the classes reside(that you write and compile)
* `src` directory is the default sourcepath
* Classpath is where your dependencies are located - libraries, jars, etc.
* Compile loads these when required for compilation.
* Runtime can use these to load bytecode - class path scan

### 11. What are the memory areas allocated in the JVM?
##### Motivation
* Distinction between heap and stack
* Class area and native area
##### Answer
* Heap
  * Space for objects in the memory
  * "Global" - like shared space 
  * When instances of objects are created, they are allocated in the heap
  * Reference variables can point to objects base the the context
  * Largest of the memory spaces
* Stack
  * Holds thread level data
  * Local variables and object references
  * Call frames for each method execution
* Code area(meta space)
  * Holds the bytecode, JIT info
* Implementation / native area
  * Resister
  * C implementation stack
  * a lot JVM are implemented in C and C++, JVM run on C and C++.
  * The low level code to run the JVM

### 12. What is differnecce bwtween Java permgen and metaspace?
##### Motivation
* Undersanding the the changes in memory management
* Awareness of the metaspace
  
##### Answer
* Memory areas in the JVM
* Before Java 8, there was a memory area called PermGen
* Java 8 onwards, there is a new memory area called Metaspace
* PermGen is gone!
* Memory for the JVM is allocated in the Metaspace
* PermGen had a fiexed max size allocated to it(configurable)
* Metaspace grows dynamically as the program runs
* Has maxMetaSpaceSize configuration. Triggers garbage collection when the metaspace exceeds this size
* Because of class loading / unloading, the metaspace can grow and shrink, no "permanent generation" anymore
  
### 13. What is garbage collection?
##### Motivation
* Awareness of the process of garbage collection
* Some details of working
* Benefits and drawbacks
  
##### Answer
* Process of removing unused and orphaned objects from the heap
* Automatic process.Does not need programmer intervention
* Has APIs to trigger programmaticlly(not recommended)
* Generation based approach(young generation, old generation, permanent generation)
* First in first out(FIFO)
* Benefit - no manual memory management
* Drawback - performance intrustion

### 14. What is JIT compiler?
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with the how JVM works
* Bytecode vs native code

##### Answer
* JVM selecctively converts certain bytecode instructions to native code(machine code)
* Converts to the native instruction set of the CPU it is running on
* Makes a judgement call based on usage of the bytecode, and performance characteristics
* Hence "Just in time"

### 15. Explain heap space configuration.
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with the heap space
* Configration flag details
* What informs the setting values?

##### Answer
* Configuration flag: -Xms, -Xmx
* -Xms: initial memery allocation pool size(starting size of the heap)
* -Xmx: maximum memory allocation pool size(don't go beyond this)
* When max heap size is reached
  * The JVM will start to collect garbage
  * or Out of memory errors will be thrown
* You don't want space to be too small(garbage collection will keep happening)
* You don't want space to be too big(waste of memory)

### 16. Explain the stack space configuration.
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with the stack space
* Configration flag details

##### Answer
* Configuration flag: -Xss
* -Xss: initial stack size
* Stack grows dynamically as the program runs
* When all available stack space is used
  * Stack overflow exception will be thrown
* Usually not a big deal
* Stack overflow usually happens when you have a circular invocation
  
### 17. What is a classloader?
##### Motivation
* Awareness of the class loading concept
* Role of classloader

##### Answer
* Part of the JRE
* It load Java classes into the runtime
* This happens only when needed
  * JVM requests a class
  * Class loader tries to find it and loads it
  * If it can't find it, it will throw a ClassNotFoundException

### 18. What are the diffrent types of classloaders?
##### Motivation
* Awareness of the class loading concept

##### Answer
* Application / System classloader
  * Classes in the class path
* Extension classloader
  * Core Java JDK classes
* Bootstrap classloader
  * Loads the other classloaders
  * Core Java runtime classes
* Custom classloader

### 19. What is `public static void main(String[] args)`?
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with modifiers
* Understanding the application startup process

##### Answer
* `public static void` are modifiers to a method called `main`
* `public` - method is accessible outside the class
* `static` - class instance is not required to run the method
* `void` - method does not return any value
* `main` - special name convention to indicate an execution entry point
  
### 20. What is the order of the modifiers are switched in the `public static void main`?
##### answer
* order of modifiers doesn't matter
* Modifiers must be before the method

### 21. Can you run code before the main method starts?
##### Motivation
* Understanding static block
##### Answer
* Yes, you can
* This can be done by using static block
* Static block is executed when the class is loaded
* So, this runs before the main method is executed

### 22. What is the difference between float and double?
##### Motivation
* Knowledge of primitive number types
* Familiarity with precision
* Knowledge of sizes allocated

##### Answer
* Both are real numbers
* Both are imprecise(need inifinite precision)
* Float takes 32 bit. Double takes 64 bit.
* Can not use equality operator to compare float and double
* Double is literally double the size of float
* Double has more precision than float
* By default, floating point numbers are double
* Use float mostly for space optimization
* A double can be cast to a float(with possible loss of precision)

### 23. Why would you need a break in a switch statement?
##### Motivation
* understanding the switch statement fall through pattern
* What happens if you don't use a break?
* Possible uses of the fall through behavior

##### Answer
* Switch case statements are't "discrete"
* If / else is discrete(ether if executes or else executes) 
* There isn't a one-to-one map between the matched case the block, if there is not break, the next case will be executed
* Case match is for where the execution starts. After that, execution falls through to the next case all the way to the end of the switch.
* One way to break it is using a break statement
* Can be used without break to group serveral matching statements
  
### 24. What are the primitive types in java?
##### Motivation
* List of primitive types
* Nature of date
* Space consumed

##### Answer
* Primitive types are:
  * byte - 8 bit signed two's complement integer
  * short - 16 bit signed two's complement integer
  * int - 32 bit signed two's complement integer
  * long - 64 bit two's complement integer(signed / unsigned)
  * float - 32 bit floating point
  * double - 64 bit floating point
  * char - 16 bit unicode character
  * boolean - One of two values: true or false, Size unknown

### 25. What is default value of local variables?
##### answer
* The local variable do not have default value.
* They need to be initialized explicitly by the programmer
* Does bot happen automatically.

### 26. Why does complier complain about local varibles initialization?
##### Answer
* Java does not initialize local variables automatically
* If you call the local variable before it is initialized, it will throw a compiler error
* These local varibles could be primitive types or reference types
* Ebore "using" a local variable, you need to have put some value to it first.
* Can be completly uninitialized. As long as it is not used, it will not be initialized.

### 27. Can a double be cast into a byte?
##### Motivation
* Understanding the casting process
* Understanding the precision of floating point numbers
##### Answer
* Yes, you can. A higher precision floating point number can be cast to a lower precision floating point number
* This needs explicit casting
```java
byte b = (byte) d;
```
* Possible loss of data(lossy conversion)

### 28. Can a byte be cast into a double?
##### Motivation
* Understanding the precision
* Implicit casting
##### Answer
* A byte does not need to be cast to a double
* It can be automatically assigned
```java
byte b = 1;
double d = b;
System.out.println(d);
```
* This is called implicit casting
  * When the lower precision number is assigned to a higher precision number
* No possible loss of data(lossless conversion)

### 29. How do you break a nested loop?
##### Motivation
* Break statement with label
* Thoughts on best practice
  * Like a goto statement
  * should be used with caution
##### Answer
* Break statement with label
```java
outer:
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    if (i == 5) {
      break outer;
    }
  }
}
```
* Indicates the statent to break out of, not where to go to
* Not a "bad" thing to use
* Diffrent from goto statement in that you cannot alter the flow of control

### 30. What are the diffrent access modifiers?
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with modifiers
* Java access rules and diffrent types of access modifiers
##### Answer
* Private
  * Within the class only
* Pckage private(default)
  * Within the package only
* Protected
  * Within the same package and subclasses
* Public
  * Cab be accessed by all

### 31. Can you overload constructors? How does it work?
##### Motivation
* Method overloading concept
* Constructor arguments with new operator
##### Answer
* Yes, you can
* Same concept as method overloading.Diffrent is that you can use the new operator to create an object
* diffrent arguments list
* Needs arguments passed via new keyword constructor invocation
```java
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```
* Overloaded contructor "hides" default no-arg constructor. Can't construct without those args anymore.
* No-arg constructor has to be implemented by the programmer

### 32. How to copy a constructor?
##### Motivation
* Constructor arguments
* What is the pattern and when to use it
##### Answer
* Specific pattern used to create a new object as a copy of another object
* Custtrotor of a class takes as argument of the same class type
* Constructor copies memebers from that instance
```java
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  Person(Person p) {
    this.name = p.name;
    this.age = p.age;
  }
}
```


### 33. What is constructor chaining?
##### Motivation
* What is the pattern and when to use it
* Why do you need it
##### Answer
* Constructor chaining is a pattern that allows you to call a constructor from another constructor to delegate part of the initialization 
* Usually constructor with more args delegates to constructor with less args
```java
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  Person(String name) {
    // this has to be the very first line in the constructor
    this(name, 0);
  }
}
```

### 34. What is the singleton pattern?
##### Motivation
* Design pattern
* How to implement it in java
* Benefits of using it
##### Answer
* Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
* Java naturally allows multiple instances. The requirement is to enforce one instance.
* Done by
  * Private constructor
  * Static instance
  * Static method that returns the instance
```java
class Person {
  private static Person instance = new Person();

  private Person() {
  }

  public static Person getInstance() {
    return instance;
  }
}
```
* Benefits and uses
  * Single instance guaranteed
  * Useful for certain objects Example: DB connection
  * Controlled life cycle
