## Conceptial Questions

### What is Java?
##### Motivation
* Familiarity with Java
* Comparison with other languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.)
##### Answer
* Object-oriented programming language
* Portable - write once, run anywhere
* Very popular today in server-side programming
* Created by Sun Microsystems, released in 1995, and is now widely used in enterprise applications

### What are some freatures of Java?
##### Motivation
* Awareness of what the Java has to offer
* Comparison with other languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.)
* Importance language characteristics
##### Answer
* Simple, object-oriented, and familiar syntax to c and c++ programmers
* Robust and secure(virtual machine)
* Architecture-neutral and platform-independent(write once and run anywhere, jvm - another abstraction layer)
* High-performance(JIT compiler)
* Interpreted, threaded and dynamic(compiled, bytecode is interpreted at the runtime, typing is statically checked, behavior is dynamic)

### What is JVM?
##### Motivation
* Diffrence bwtween JVM and JRE
* Characteristics of JVM
* Role it plays in execution
##### Answer
* JVM - Java virtual machine
* It's the runtime environment for Java programs, a extra layer of abstraction over the hardware
* Takes the compiled bytecode and executes it
* input to the JVM is the Bycode, output is the machine code
* Has a specification that outlines how it should work
* Diffrent implementation available
* Essentialy in making Java platform agnostic(write once and run anywhere)

### What is JRE?
##### Motivation
* Diffrence bwtween JVM and JRE
* Characteristics of JRE
* Role it plays in execution

##### Answer
* JRE - Java run time environment
* It is a set of software elements that together provide the environment in which Java programs are executed
* Constists of
  * Class loader
  * JVM
  * Libraries and utilities
* The JRE orchestrates the activities of these software elements
* Installed on machines that run Java
